= Package Structure

== Overview

The BMM packages are as follows:

* `org.openehr.lang.bmm`: the BMM
** `model_access`: the interface to most features including schema load/reload, generally used by an application as a reflection library;
** `core`: the core BMM classes used for in-memory representation of an object model. This consists of a number of sub-packages:
*** `model`: meta-types representing models and packages;
*** `entity`: meta-types representing classes and types including enumeration types, represented in the `range_constrained` sub-package;
*** `feature`: meta-types representing classes features, i.e. constants, routines, properties;
*** `literal_value`: meta-types representing literal values;
*** `expression`: an expression meta-model sufficient for expressing first-order predicate logic expressions, including class invariants and pre- and post-conditions.

Related packages are:

* the `org.openehr.lang.bmm_persistence` package, described in the {openehr_bmm_persistence}[BMM Persistence specification^], which contains the BMM Persistence classes.

These are illustrated below.
