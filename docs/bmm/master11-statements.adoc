= Statements

== Overview

BMM provides meta-model elements for defining the _body_ of a routine, consisting of _statements_. This facility is not needed for achieving the original purpose of BMM, i.e. a computable in-memory representation of a model at the interface level (classes, types and signatures), rather it provides a basis for representing program logic, such as function definitions. 

BMM statements are formalised using the classes `BMM_STATEMENT_ITEM`, `BMM_STATEMENT_BLOCK` and `BMM_STATEMENT` and various descendant types, as shown in the UML view below.

The use of the three-class hierarchy pattern allows a Routine `_body_` to be a simple statement or a _block_, containing statements and/or more blocks. The class `BMM_STATEMENT` is abstract, allowing specific statement meta-models to be developed whose 'statement' meta-types inherit from this class. A number of common types are included by default, and are described below.

This facility is primarily provided to support the definition of higher-level languages by embedding them in the outer BMM meta-model.

== Assignment

A BMM assignment is the same concept as found in most frame-based programming languages, and provides a meta-model to represent a writable target (variable or property) being assigned to from a source, which is any expression of the same evaluation type. Type checking is thus based on a comparison of `_definition.type_` of the target and `_eval_type_()` of the source.

The following example shows a simple assignment in the definition of the function `_position_`.

[source,typescript]
----
class Simple_bank_account

feature -- Definitions

    overdraft_limit: Decimal = 250;

feature -- State

    balance: Decimal;

feature -- Interface

    position: Decimal {
        Result := balance + overdraft_limit
    }

invariant
    Solvent: position >= 0.0
----

The BMM meta-model for this statement is shown below.

== Procedure Call

A procedure call is represented in BMM by the meta-type `BMM_PROCEDURE_CALL`, which refers to an instance of `EL_PROCEDURE_AGENT`, the same way that a function call is represented in terms of an `EL_FUNCTION_AGENT`. In the following example, the procedure `_put_()` is called from the `_deposit_()` and `_withdraw_()` functions in the class `Account_access`.

[source,typescript]
----
class Simple_bank_account

feature -- Modification

    put (val: Decimal)
        precondition
            valid_amount: val + overdraft_limit >= 0.0
    {
        balance := balance + val
    }

class Account_access {

feature -- Command

    deposit (v: Decimal; ac: Simple_bank_account)
        pre_condition
            valid_amount: v > 0.0
    {
        ac.put (v);
    }

    withdraw (v: Decimal; ac: Simple_bank_account)
        pre_condition
            valid_amount: ac.overdraft_limit - v >= 0.0
    {
        ac.put (-v);
    }
----

The BMM meta-model instance structure for the call is shown below.

== Action Tables

The BMM `statement` package includes the meta-classes `BMM_ACTION_TABLE` and `BMM_CONDITIONAL_ACTION`, which together provide a way of representing a decision table whose outputs are statements (rather than values, as in the case of the related Expression meta-classes `EL_DECISION_TABLE` and `EL_CONDITIONAL_EXPRESSION`). An action table corresponds closely to the standard constructs 'if/then/elseif' and the case statement.

The following example shows a typical instance of the BMM Action table meta-type, within a procedure that generates appropriate alerts or alarms based on patient vital signs.

[source,typescript]
----
    check_vital_signs
        if systolic_pressure.in_range ([critical_high])
            raise_alarm ([emergency])

        elseif systolic_pressure.in_range ([high]) and oxygen_sat.in_range([low])
            call_staff
        end
    end
----

In a more functional-style syntax, this might be written as:

[source,typescript]
----
    check_vital_signs
        ============================================================================
        systolic_pressure.in_range ([critical_high]):     raise_alarm ([emergency]),
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        systolic_pressure.in_range ([high]) and 
        oxygen_sat.in_range([low]):                       call_staff
        ============================================================================
    end
----

== Assertions

The BMM `statement` model includes a statement meta-type to represent the notion of an _assertion_ as a statement, typically expressed in syntax such as `assert (<boolean expression>)`. This kind of statement is understood as an executable instruction to check that the condition is true, and if not, to generate an exception of the appropriate type, assuming exceptions are available.
