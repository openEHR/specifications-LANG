= Functional Elements

== Overview

BMM provides support for representing functional entities, often known as {wikipedia_lambda_calculus}[lambdas^]. The two key functional entities are known in the calculus as a _lambda term_ and an _application_. The first is more commonly understood by programmers as a _delayed routine call_, here denoted by the term _agent_. The latter is what programmers understand as a 'call', i.e. an application of a lambda term.

An agent is formed by reference to a function or procedure in an expression context, potentially with provision of some or all arguments. This creates an entity whose type is an instance of the meta-type `BMM_SIGNATURE`. There are three variations as follows:

* _no arguments supplied_: this is just a reference to a function or procedure by name, and is typically used to pass it as an argument to some other routine;
* _some arguments supplied_: this generates a new delayed function or procedure call whose formal signature is the projection of the remaining open arguments with respect to the original signature;
* _all arguments supplied_: this generates a new fully closed delayed call that may be invoked.

A call is thus an invocation of a _closed agent_. The effective type of a function call is the result type of the original function definition, thus its meta-type is just `BMM_TYPE`. A procedure call has no effective type.

Both calls and agents are special kinds of _references_ to their original routines, and both can appear within an expression context, including as arguments passed to routine invocations. Accordingly, they are not defined within BMM, which is focused on _types_, but in the `lang.elom.expression` package of the {openehr_expression_language}[openEHR Expression Language model^], of which the functional view is shown below.

== Agents

In the model the three classes `EL_AGENT`, `EL_FUNCTION_AGENT`, and `EL_PROCEDURE_AGENT` (centre) define respectively, Agent and its Function and Procedure forms. An Agent is understood as one kind of terminal expression element (`EL_TERMINAL`), since it is concretely a _reference_ that generates a value, in this case, to a routine that generates a delayed call object. It potentially has `_closed_args_`, in the form of an `EL_TUPLE` which is a meta-type for tuple instances, which instantiate an instance `BMM_TUPLE_TYPE` (such as `[String, Integer]`). The items of the tuple are each in the form of an `EL_TUPLE_ITEM` consisting of the argument name (optional) and an `_item_`, which is an `EL_EXPRESSION`, having an `_effective_type_` of `BMM_TYPE`. By this means, the actual arguments to a routine call may be any expression, including operators, and (as shown), terminal expressions. This includes other agent expressions, and also function calls (but not procedure calls, since they are not value-generating entities).

An example of a delayed function call in syntax form is `nodeCount (struct=?, depth=3)` (the exact syntax will vary according to programming language). Here, the `_struct_` argument is left open, while the `_depth_` argument is closed with the supplied value `3`. This expression generates an agent whose signature is `[StructType]:Integer` (assuming the concrete type of the `struct` argument is `StructType`). This capability is known as {wikipedia_currying}[function currying^] and is the basis for enabling delayed routine calls to have their arguments progressively filled before final execution, each time generating a new agent with a reduced signature.

== Calls

On the left of the UML diagram is the meta-class `EL_FUNCTION_CALL`, which represents a call to a function Agent, and which is also an `EL_TERMINAL`. For such a call to be possible, all arguments must be supplied (which may be none, in the case of a parameterless function).

An example of a Function Call is `_calculateAge_ ('1982-03-22', '2019-06-01')`, which calculates a person's age from his date of birth and a given date. In normal programming languages, any of the parameters may be any referenceable value-returning entity, i.e. any in-scope variable, other function call, or a valid operator expression, e.g. `_calculateAge_ ('1982-03-22', _today_())`, where `_today_()` is a function returning the date of today.

Such calls are direct equivalents for expressions using basic mathematical operators and functions, on the usual basis that any operator (such as 'plus', i.e. `+`) is formally defined as a function such as `add (arg1, arg2: Numeric): Numeric`.

The instance structure for a typical expression such as the Body Mass Index (BMI), i.e. `weight / height^2`, is shown below.
