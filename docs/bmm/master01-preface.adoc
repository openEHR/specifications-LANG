= Preface

== Purpose

This document describes the Basic Meta-Model (BMM), a model of object models. It may be considered as an approximate replacement for the UML XMI. It is human-readable and writable, and supports generic types (open and closed), container types, and multiple inheritance.

== Status

This specification is in the {spec_status} state. The development version of this document can be found at {openehr_bmm}[{openehr_bmm}^].

Known omissions or questions are indicated in the text with a 'to be determined' paragraph, as follows:

*TBD*: (example To Be Determined paragraph)

NOTE: Other than for working with particular tools designed to use BMM, BMM is not a required formalism for implementing openEHR, and other methods of accessing models computably may be used, including UML and software implementations of the openEHR Reference Model.

== Feedback

Feedback may be provided on the {openehr_lang_forum}[openEHR languages specifications forum^].

Issues may be raised on the {component_prs}[specifications Problem Report tracker^].

To see changes made due to previously reported issues, see the {component_history}[{component} component Change Request tracker^].

== Conformance

Conformance of a data or software artifact to an openEHR specification is determined by a formal test of that artifact against the relevant {openehr_its_component}[openEHR Implementation Technology Specification(s) (ITSs)^], such as an IDL interface or an XML-schema. Since ITSs are formal derivations from underlying models, ITS conformance indicates model conformance.

== Previous Versions

=== Version 3.0.0

This version made major changes to the `BMM_TYPE` hierarchy and semantics, enabling generic inheritance by generic and non-generic classes to be represented.

=== Version 3.1.0

This version adds meta-classes for computational elements to BMM, including:

* routines, variables, constants;
* expressions (including assertions);
* statements.

It makes various adjustments to the existing model attributes and classes. The BMM remains compatible with P_BMM 2.x, i.e. any existing `.bmm` file can be parsed to create a v 3.1.0 BMM instance.

== A Note on Language

The elements of meta-models are sometimes named confusingly in the literature and within various programming language technologies. In this specification, we use the following terms:

class:: generally refers to a class defined in a model expressed in BMM, i.e. an instance of a BMM meta-class;
meta-class:: refers to a class in the BMM itself, such as `BMM_CLASS`, in order to clearly distinguish it from classes defined in models represented using BMM;
feature (of a class):: any stored or computed element of a class, including constants, attributes (properties) and routines (methods);
property:: a stored class feature; also known as 'attribute';
routine:: a computed class feature that may be either value-returning (a function) or work-performing (a procedure);
function:: a routine that computes and returns a value; typically causes no side-effects in the object;
procedure:: a routine that performs a computation; typically has side-effects;
generic (class or type):: a kind of class or type that has parameters of other types; known as 'template' type in some programming languages;
type:: generally refers to a type defined in a model expressed in BMM, i.e. an instance of a BMM meta-type;
meta-type:: refers to a type in the BMM itself, which is either a class (such as `BMM_CLASS`) or generically derived (meta-)type in the sense of being an instance generator, where the instances will be concrete type definitions in models represented using BMM.

== Tooling

The {openehr_archie_github}[openEHR Archie Library^] fully implements this specification in Java and may be used to build UI tools for compiling, viewing and editing BMM models.

The {openehr_awb}[openEHR ADL Workbench (AWB)] fully implements this specification, and provides a convenient way of illustrating BMM semantics. The screenshots used in this specification are all from the ADL Workbench. The tool is written in the Eiffel language, and is available as {openehr_awb_github}[open source on Github^]. The BMM libraries can be found in the {eomf_bmm}[EOMF Github repository^].
