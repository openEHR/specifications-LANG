= Classes

== Overview

This section describes the semantics of the `BMM_CLASS` meta-class, its sub-types, constituent parts and relationships. The parts of a class are collectively known as _features_, and consist of functions, procedures, constants and properties. The following UML illustrates classes and relationships to constituent feature meta-types. (Features are described in detail in the following section.)

Class definitions are the _definitional_ basis of a BMM model, i.e. they are the means of defining the types that are statically used in the model, and the dynamic types generated at runtime. Types are thus _derived_ entities.

BMM distinguishes between simple and generic class definitions via two descendants of `BMM_CLASS`, i.e. `BMM_SIMPLE_CLASS` and `BMM_GENERIC_CLASS`, with the first providing a concrete form of `BMM_CLASS` that applies to non-generic classes, and the latter defining the additional semantics of generic classes. The meta-type `BMM_ENUMERATION` is a specialisation of `BMM_SIMPLE_CLASS` used to represent enumeration classes in BMM models. The non-simple meta-types are further described below.

NOTE: not currently supported: export status; 'static' (non-instance dependent) methods; anchored types.

== Enumeration Classes

The enumeration meta-type adds a set of enumeration labels and optional `String` or `Integer` values, in the manner of contemporary languages such as Java and C#. This meta-type allows classes to be declared in a BMM to be enumerations without either having to manufacture a representation from simple class definitions, or having to replicate the representation of enumerations in some target language. The following screenshot shows how a BMM integer enumeration class appears within a BMM model.

The types `String` and `Integer` are assumed to be defined via primitive classes of the same names.

== Generic Classes

The generic class meta-type `BMM_GENERIC_CLASS` adds generic parameters to `BMM_CLASS`, enabling formal generic parameters to be represented. Each such parameter is expressed using an instance of `BMM_PARAMETER_TYPE` which names the parameter and optionally allows a type constraint to be associated with it, in the usual object-oriented fashion. In BMM, formal parameters have single-letter names, such as 'T', 'U' etc, following typical usage in programming languages. The following example shows a generic class `Interval<T:Ordered>`, which is a class `Interval` with one formal parameter `T` constrained to be of type `Ordered` or any descendant.

== Primitive Classes

Any class definitions can be marked as being 'primitive' within a BMM model, enabling them to be visualised and queried as a separate group without otherwise impacting on the semantics of the entity in BMM meta-type system. The following shows part of a BMM model in which a number of classes are classified as primitive (shown in light and dark grey).

Primitive classes are normal BMM classes, other than being marked primitive for convenience, and do not have different semantics.
