= EL Basics

== Syntax style

The syntax style used in EL is inspired by elements of common languages available today, including TypeScript, Kotlin, Java, etc, with divergences to provide a syntax that is more easily readable to non-IT professionals as well as IT professionals.

The lexical style used in EL is a form of so-called 'snake_case' rather than so-called 'CamelCase', in common with other openEHR specifications, but either may be used in real applications. One reason for using snake-case is be to render EL Modules more readable to the non-IT professional. Upper- and lower-case are not formally distinguished, and the use of upper case is a matter of style only, as follows:

* _class names_: upper-case first letter followed by alphanumerics with underscores where spaces would occur in natural language, e.g. `Iso8601_date_time`, `Arrayed_list<T>`;
* _property, routine and variable names_: lower-case first letter, followed by alphanumerics with underscores, e.g. `_employee_group_`, `_average_pressure_()`;
* _constants and class (static) functions_: upper-case first letter, followed by alphanumerics with underscores, e.g. `Maximum_speed`.

TBD: specify equivalence between snake-case and CamelCase, or a tool-level switch?

== Commenting

Comments are of two styles. For end-of-line commenting, and for creating visual dividing lines, the leader pattern `'--'` is used. Dividing lines are simply a longer line, e.g `'---------'`.

Comment-only lines start with the bar character (`'|'`). The example below shows both forms.

----
    |
    | patient fit to undertake regime
    |
    patient_fit:
        Result := not
            (platelets.in_range ([very_low]) or  -- platelets can't be too low
             neutrophils.in_range ([very_low]))
----

[.tbd]
TBD: allow comment-lines using '========'?

== Typing

The Expression language is fully typed, with type definitions being supplied by one or more models, represented in the {openehr_bmm}[openEHR BMM specification^]. *All operators are assumed to be implemented by and map to functions defined on types*, including operators such as '+' mapping to the function `add()` defined on primitive types such as `Integer`. Accordingly, such operators are defined within the BMM as being operator _aliases_ of their implementing function, which is made possible by the BMM meta-types `BMM_ROUTINE` and descendants. 

An important implementation consequence of this approach is that an expression that is parsed to a classic operator-based AST may be evaluated by progressively searching for operator-aliased functions within the model definition, invoking with the arguments found in the AST structure, and returning Results for the next such computation. Of course, use of built-in native types and functions  (rather than always dispatching via a BMM) to handle primitive type operators is likely to be used in the interests of efficiency. Function-matching can be implemented by matching the inferred signature of the operator and its argument(s) with functions having both a conformant (not necessarily identical) signature, and the same operator.

Such model definitions will therefore include primitive type definitions, either the openEHR {openehr_foundation_types}[Foundation Types^], i.e. primitive types, container types and interval types, or ones that correspond very closely. In the interests of completeness, EL _assumes_ the openEHR Foundation Types, so as to have a minimal basis. 

== EL Foundation Types

The EL syntax for these is described below.

=== Primitive Types

The EL primitive types are shown below.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|=================================================================
|Name                   |Description
| `Boolean`             |Boolean value
|                       |
| `Integer`             |Integer value
| `Integer64`           |Large integer value
| `Real`                |Real value
| `Double`              |Large real value
|                       |
| `Date`                |ISO 8601-format date
| `Date_time`           |ISO 8601-format date/time
| `Time`                |ISO 8601-format time
| `Duration`            |ISO 8601-format duration
|                       |
| `String`              |String
|                       |
| `Uri`                 |Uri in {rfc3986}[IETF RFC 3986^] format
| `Terminology_code`    |Terminology code reference
|=================================================================

Automatic type promotion from `Integer` to `Real` applies to all integer and real values and expressions, in the same fashion as most programming languages.

=== Container Types

The same container types as defined in the {openehr_foundation_types}#_structure_types[Foundation Types, `structure` package^] are assumed in EL, under the following names.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|=================================================================
|Name                   |Description
| `Container<T>`        |Abstract parent of `List`, `Set` and `Hash` types
| `List<T>`             |Linear list of items of any primitive type, allowing order and repeated membership
| `Set<T>`              |Set of items of any primitive type; no order, unique membership
| `Hash<K:Ordered, V>`  |Indexed linear container
|=================================================================

=== Interval Type

The same `Interval` type as defined in the {openehr_foundation_types}#_interval[Foundation Types, `interval` package^] is assumed in EL, under the following names.

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|=================================================================
|Name                   |Description

| `Interval<T>`         |Interval of any ordered type
| `Point_interval<T>`   |Sub-type used to efficiently represent closed intervals whose boundaries are the same
| `Proper_interval<T>`  |Sub-type used to efficiently represent intervals whose boundaries are different
|=================================================================

Automatic type promotion from `Interval<Integer>` to `Interval<Real>` applies to all integer and real values and expressions, in the same fashion as most programming languages.

=== Complex Types

Complex types are imported from a formal model definition, expressed in {openehr_bmm}[openEHR BMM format^], or any formal equivalent. The types in a model definition included in this way become available within the formalism in the same way as the foundation types, and may be used in expressions in the same way.
