= EL Basics

== Overview

The openEHR Expression Language (EL) syntax is defined in a number of layers. The core of the language defines _expressions_, which are value-returning entities formed by reference or invocation of declared entities such as variables, functions and constants. Expressions may be used in isolation within some larger context in an openEHR system (e.g. Plan or Guideline), with the connection of variables to real-world data being determined implicitly, as described above.

The next layer includes non-expression elements, allowing explicit declarations, assignments and control structures, including rules. These are known as _statements_. A collection of statements may be used within another context in the same way as bare expressions.

The fullest form of EL syntax is an _EL Module_ which provides all of the context, terminology, meta-data and so on, enabling the representation of fully-formed guidelines and other similar artefacts.

These layers are shown below.

== Syntax style

The syntax style used in EL is of the Pascal variety, i.e. words rather than programming symbols such as braces (`{}`). The intention is to provide a syntax that is more easily readable to non-IT professionals as well as IT professionals, since it is likely that healthcare professionals will be among the principle authors of EL texts. This choice leads to syntax such as the following.

----
    -- a universal quantifier expression
    if for_all v in $systolic_bp_samples : v <= Systolic_bp_threshold then
        -- statements
    end
    
    -- a when/then block
    when $systolic_bp
        matches |>= 200.0| then
            -- statements to raise emergency alert

        matches |>= 180.0| then
            -- statements to request nurse check

        ...
    end    
----

In the above, nearly all lexical elements are words, such as `if`, `in`, `when`, `then` and so on, leading to a more natural reading experience.

The style chosen here should not be regarded as fixed, and indeed it is a relatively simple matter to create alternative 'syntax skins', such as one for developers used to C language syntax descendants such as Java, TypeScript and so on.

The lexical style used is so-called 'snake_case' rather than so-called 'CamelCase', in common with other openEHR specifications, but either may be used in real applications. One reason for using snake-case may be to render EL Modules more readable to the non-IT professional.

== Types

The Expression language is fully typed, and _assumes_ the same set of {openehr_foundation_types}[Foundation Types] as other openEHR components, namely:

* primitive types;
* container types:
** `List<T>`, i.e. an ordered list of elements of primitive type T;
** `Set<T>`, i.e. a set of elements of primitive type T;
** `Hash<K:Ordered,V>`, i.e. a Hash table or dictionary;
* an interval type:
** `Interval<T: Ordered>` where T is any ordered primitive type, i.e. `Integer`, `Real`, and any of the Date/time types.

Complex types based on these types may also be used in EL.

=== Primitive Types

The primitive types are shown below.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|=================================================================
|Name                   |Description

| `Boolean`             |Boolean value
| `Integer`             |Integer value
| `Real`                |Real value
| `Date`                |ISO 8601-format date
| `Date_time`           |ISO 8601-format date/time
| `Time`                |ISO 8601-format time
| `Duration`            |ISO 8601-format duration
| `String`              |String
| `Uri`                 |Uri in {rfc3986}[IETF RFC 3986^] format
| `Terminology_code`    |Terminology code reference
|=================================================================

Automatic type promotion from `Integer` to `Real` applies to all integer and real values and expressions, in the same fashion as most programming languages.

TBD: do we need `Integer64` and `Real64`?

=== Container Types

The same container types as defined in the {openehr_foundation_types}#_structure_types[BASE Foundation Types specification] are supported in EL, as follows.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|=================================================================
|Name                   |Description

| `Container<T>`        |Abstract parent of `List`, `Set` and `Hash` types
| `List<T>`             |Linear list of items of any primitive type, allowing order and repeated membership
| `Set<T>`              |Set of items of any primitive type; no order, unique membership
| `Hash<K:Ordered, V>`  |Indexed linear container
|=================================================================

[.tbd]
TBD: the following is functional style; we would need keywords to enable it in the EL syntax, e.g. `has` etc. Also, `has()` can be done via `there_exists()`.

The above types each have an assumed interface consisting of functions and procedures that apply to all members of the container, consistent with the semantics of the container. These include the following.

----
    has (v: T): Boolean
            -- True if container contains v
----

Any such method may be accessed in the usual way, using dot notation, i.e. as shown below for the method `_has()_`.

----
    heart_rrate_samples: List<Real>
    High_threshold: Real = 200.0
    
    if heart_rate_samples.has (High_threshold) then
        -- statements
    end
----

=== Interval Type

The same `Interval` type as defined in the {openehr_foundation_types}#_interval[BASE Foundation Types specification] is supported in EL, as follows.

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|=================================================================
|Name                   |Description

| `Interval<T>`         |Interval of any ordered primitive
|=================================================================

Automatic type promotion from `Interval<Integer>` to `Interval<Real>` applies to all integer and real values and expressions, in the same fashion as most programming languages.

[.tbd]
TBD: the following is functional style; we would need keywords to enable it in the EL syntax, e.g. `contains`, `overlaps` etc.

Various methods are defined for `Interval<T>`, as follows.

----
    has (v: T): Boolean
            -- True if for Interval contains v

    overlaps (other: like Current): Boolean
            -- True if this Interval overlaps other
            
    contains (other: like Current): Boolean
            -- True if this Interval contains other
----

=== Complex Types

Complex types may be implicitly accessible, or explicitly imported from formal model definitions specified in the `use_model` section of an EL Module. Such models need to be specified in {openehr_bmm}[openEHR BMM format], or any functional equivalent. The types in models included in this way become available within the formalism in the same way as the foundation types, and may be used in declarations etc in the normal way.

Access to interior elements of instances of non-primitive types is obtained using 'dot' notation, i.e. the standard way for object-oriented languages.

== Function and Procedure Calls

In EL, the function and procedure calls are the primary means to make complex logic available to expressions. Both functions and procedures are supported, and are collectively known as _routines_, as per the {openehr_bmm}#_elements[openEHR Basic Meta-Model (BMM)].

In EL, a function is a routine that returns a result and is assumed to have no side-effects on previously declared entities. It has a signature of the form:

----
    <T_arg1, T_arg2, ....>: T_result
----

Typical examples of function signatures:

----
    : Date                          -- signature of a 0-order function like current_date()
    <Real, Real>: Real              -- signature of a 2nd-order function like '*' for the domain R
    <Integer, Integer>: Integer     -- signature of a 2nd-order function like 'add' for the domain I
----

A procedure is a routine with a signature of the form:

----
    <T_arg1, T_arg2, ....>
----

This represents a call taking 0 or more arguments, with no return type. Typical procedure signatures include the following:

----
    <Real>                          -- a 1st-order procedure for the domain R
    <String, Integer>               -- signature of a procedure taking a String and an Integer argument
----

EL does not provide a way to programmatically define routines (i.e. it does not try to be a programming language), instead, it provides a way of _declaring routine signatures_, using the `func` and `proc` keywords. This is similar to the declaration of methods in interface classes in languages like C# and Java.

Functions and procedures are mapped to class methods in external libraries in the <<_computing_bindings, Computing Bindings>> section of an EL Module.
