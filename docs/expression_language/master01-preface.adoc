= Preface

== Purpose

This document specifies an abstract openEHR Expression Language (openEHR EL) that provides a syntax counterpart to the `expression` package in the {openehr_bmm}[openEHR Basic Meta-Model (BMM)^]. This may be used within BMM models, to specify archetype rules, and in decision language expressions.

The intended audience includes:

* Standards bodies producing health informatics standards;
* Academic groups using openEHR;
* Solution vendors.

== Related Documents

Prerequisite documents for reading this document include:

== Conformance

Conformance of a data or software artifact to an openEHR specification is determined by a formal test of that artifact against the relevant {openehr_its_component}[openEHR Implementation Technology Specification(s) (ITSs)^], such as an IDL interface or an XML-schema. Since ITSs are formal derivations from underlying models, ITS conformance indicates model conformance.
