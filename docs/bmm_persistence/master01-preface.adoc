= Preface

== Purpose

This document describes a persistence model for the Basic Meta-Model (BMM) known as `P_BMM`, that may be used as a basis for serialisation of BMM models. It may be considered as an approximate replacement for the UML XMI for data-only models. It is human-readable and writable, and supports generic types (open and closed), container types, and multiple inheritance.

== Status

This specification is in the {spec_status} state. The development version of this document can be found at {openehr_bmm_persistence}[{openehr_bmm_persistence}^].

Known omissions or questions are indicated in the text with a 'to be determined' paragraph, as follows:
[.tbd]
*TBD*: (example To Be Determined paragraph)

== Feedback

Feedback may be provided on the {openehr_lang_forum}[openEHR languages specifications forum^].

Issues may be raised on the {component_prs}[specifications Problem Report tracker^].

To see changes made due to previously reported issues, see the {component_history}[{component} component Change Request tracker^].

== Conformance

Conformance of a data or software artifact to an openEHR specification is determined by a formal test of that artifact against the relevant {openehr_its_component}[openEHR Implementation Technology Specification(s) (ITSs)^], such as an IDL interface or an XML-schema. Since ITSs are formal derivations from underlying models, ITS conformance indicates model conformance.

== Tooling

The {openehr_awb}[openEHR ADL Workbench (AWB)^] fully implements this specification, and provide a convenient way of illustrating BMM semantics. The screenshots used in this specification are all from the ADL Workbench. The tool is written in the Eiffel language, and is available as {openehr_awb_github}[open source on Github^]. The BMM libraries can be found in the {eomf_bmm}[EOMF Github repository^].

A modelling tool known as Archie implements BMM in Java, and {openehr_archie_github}[can be found in the openEHR Github area^].
