2+^h|*EL_CASE_TABLE<T>*

h|*Description*
2+a|Compound expression consisting of a list of value-range / expression pairs, and an  `_else_` member that as a whole, represents a case statement flavour of decision table.

Evaluated by iterating through `_items_` and for each one, comparing `_input_` to the item `_value_range_`. If the `_input_` is in the range, the evaluation result of the table is that item's `_result_` evaluation result.

If no member of `_items_` has a True-returning `_condition_`, the evaluation result is the result of evaluating the `_else_` expression.
