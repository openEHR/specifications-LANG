h|*0..1*
|*is_synthesised_generic*: `Boolean`

|*is_composition*: `Boolean`
a|True if this property instance is a compositional sub-part of the owning class instance. Equivalent to 'composition' in UML associations (but missing from UML properties without associations) and also 'cascade-delete' semantics in ER schemas.
