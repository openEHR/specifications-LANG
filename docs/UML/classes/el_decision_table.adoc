h|*Class*
2+^h|*EL_DECISION_TABLE*

h|*Description*
2+a|Compound expression consisting of a chain of condition-gated expressions, and an ungated `_else_` member that as a whole, represents a decision table.

Evaluated by iterating through `_items_` and for each one, evaluating its `_condition_`, which if True, causes the evaluation result of the chain to be that item's `_expression_` evaluation result. If no member of `_items_` has a True-returning `_condition_`, the evaluation result is the result of evaluating the `_else_` expression.

This structure may be used to represent value-returning if/then/else chains and case statements.
